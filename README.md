This project is designed to lock school doors in a cascading system.
As a prototype of what we want to happen, we want to use RF receivers and transmitters to send and receive signals to lock the first lock. 
After the first lock LED's will be used to mimic the other locks.
Each LED will  flash in a cascading system one by one. # Fast-Door-Locking-System
